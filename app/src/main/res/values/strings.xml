    //pasta carbonara

    <string name="carbonaraIngredients">Pasta Carbonara
        \n 400g (14 oz) spaghetti or any pasta of your choice
\n 150g (5 oz) pancetta or guanciale, diced (you can also use bacon as a substitute)
        \n 3 large eggs
\n 1 cup (about 100g) grated Pecorino Romano cheese (or Parmesan)
\n 1 clove garlic, peeled (optional)
\n Salt and black pepper to taste
\n Fresh parsley, chopped, for garnish (optional)
</string>

    <string name="carbonaraDesc">Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta according to the package instructions until al dente.
\n While the pasta is cooking, heat a bit of olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the diced pancetta or guanciale and cook until it becomes crispy. If using bacon, cook until it\'s just beginning to brown.
\n In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, grated Pecorino Romano cheese, a pinch of black pepper, and a small pinch of salt. Set aside.
\n If you like a hint of garlic flavor, you can add a peeled clove of garlic to the pancetta while it cooks. Remove the garlic before adding the pasta and eggs.
\n Once the pasta is cooked, drain it but reserve about 1 cup of pasta cooking water.
\n Immediately add the hot, drained pasta to the pan with the pancetta (remove the garlic if used). Toss everything together to coat the pasta with the rendered fat.
\n Remove the pan from heat, and quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta. Toss vigorously to combine. The heat from the pasta will help create a creamy sauce.
\n If the sauce seems too thick, gradually add some of the reserved pasta cooking water until you reach the desired consistency.
\n Season with additional black pepper and salt if needed.
\n Garnish with chopped fresh parsley if desired, and serve immediately.
